        My name is Joshua Arceo. Born and raised in Miami, I'm passionate about creating and have a very artistic vision. 
        I'm talented with front-end development and marketing. In my free time, I like to play video games, produce, and write music. 
        I'm also a self-taught musician, with skills in singing and playing instruments like the guitar and piano.
